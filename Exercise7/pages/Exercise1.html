    <h1 style="text-align: center; "><u>Harry Potter and the Chambers of Secrets</u></h1> <!-- Title -->

        <u>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</u> is a Fantasy and Adventure
        genre book.<br> 
        It is my favorite book because I like books that is more on Fantasy, 
        and it is the first book<br> 
        that I bought for myself. The story was very <b style="color: red;"><i>interesting</i></b> because of the twist of the book especially when they revealed that<br>
        Voldemort was a <b style="color: red;"><i>former</i></b> student in Hogwarts. The book also gave me <b style="color: red;"><i>wonderful</i></b> lessons, on how we treat people, and treat everyone equally.<br>
        I will suggest this to people who are interested in fantasy, imagination, and adventure books. It is a very <b style="color: red;"><i>nice</i></b> book, and it will be <b style="color: red;"><i>entertaining</i></b> if you will read all seven books.
