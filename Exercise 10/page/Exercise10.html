                <li><p><b>Basketball</b> is one of my favorite sports, because of basketball I was able to get to know a lot of people and make a lot of friends.
                        I was playing Basketball<br> when I was grade 6 I started out late, and some of my childhood friends are already better than me. I was not into basketball
                        when I was kid, but because<br> some of my uncles they showed me why Basketball is a good sport. 
                        They taught me but it was still not enough since I cannot keep up with my friends.</p></li>
