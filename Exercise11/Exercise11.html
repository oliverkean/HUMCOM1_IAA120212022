                Buttered chicken is my most favorite foods to eat, along with the Buffalo Chicken Wings
                because I like the how it is spicy at the same time yummy, in my view once I ate one chicken
                I will likely crave it again. I like all foods but this is my most favorite one to eat.

                Basketball is one of my favorite sports to play, since it is the first sport I played when I was
                a kid. Basketball, was one of the reasons why I know a lot of people and I made a lot of friends 
                because of the sport.

                One Piece is one of the anime series that I have been watching since I was grade 6, until know it is ongoing
                where it has already reached 1000 episodes, it is one of my favorite anime because it is a funny anime, and 
                there are lots of mysteries to be solved on what will happen on the ending since until now it is still ongoing.
