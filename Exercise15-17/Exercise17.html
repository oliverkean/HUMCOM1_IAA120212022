    <h2>b.) What is the output?</h2>
    <p>this second assigned value in the myText variable has been overwritten with Today is another busy day
        the last assigned value of myText will only be shown, since it is overwritten
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>c.) Replace var with let, describe the output</h2>
    <p>The output is still <b>Today is another busy day!, since it is still being overwritten by the preceding assigned value</b> </p>
    <br><br>

    <h2>d.) Replace let with const, describe the output</h2>
    <p>It shows an error output, because it is a constant variable, the value of the variable cannot be changed.</p>
